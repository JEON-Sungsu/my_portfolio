# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds all application code. Key folders include `components/` (layout, section, and page-level React components), `data/` for structured content, `hooks/` for reusable logic, `styles/` for theme tokens, and `utils/` for helpers.
- `public/` stores static assets served as-is. Use it for favicons and meta files that must bypass the bundler.
- `assets/` centralizes imagery consumed by React components. Reference files via import paths, not relative URLs.
- `dist/` is generated by Vite builds; never edit it manually. Clean or remove before committing deployment artifacts.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
```bash
npm install         # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start the Vite dev server with hot reloading
npm run build       # Produce the optimized `dist/` bundle
npm run preview     # Serve the built bundle locally for smoke tests
npm run lint        # Run ESLint with the shared React ruleset
```
Run `npm run lint` before every commit; use `npm run preview` for final checks against production output.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- JavaScript/JSX uses ES modules, 2-space indentation, semicolons, and single quotes; rely on IDE formatting that respects `.editorconfig` defaults.
- React components live in PascalCase directories and files (e.g., `Hero/Hero.jsx`). Shared hooks should be prefixed with `use`.
- Styles rely on `styled-components`; co-locate styled primitives with their component files and keep theme values in `src/styles`.
- ESLint (`eslint.config.js`) enforces React, hooks, and refresh rules—fix any reported issues before pushing.

## Testing Guidelines
- Automated tests are not yet configured. Perform manual regression checks in `npm run preview`, validating routing, animations, and responsive states.
- When introducing tests, prefer Vitest with React Testing Library, placing specs under `src/__tests__/` and matching component names (e.g., `Hero.test.jsx`).
- Document any new test scripts in `package.json` and update this guide accordingly.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow conventional commits observed in history (`feat:`, `fix:`). Scope additions where helpful (e.g., `feat(header): ...`).
- Each PR should include: context summary, screenshots or GIFs for visual changes, linked issues, and explicit testing notes.
- Keep PRs focused; split large efforts into reviewable slices. Ensure lint passes and the preview build renders before requesting review.

## Deployment & Environment Notes
- Production deploys target Vercel; confirm environment variables through project settings rather than `.env` commits.
- Use `npm run build` locally to validate before triggering a deployment. Attach the preview URL to the PR for reviewer validation.
